                    In the era of Industry 4.0, while technological advancements have made food delivery more accessible, they have also reduced cooking skills, especially among Vietnamâ€™s Gen Z. Dependence on convenience foods poses health risks due to excess oil, salt, and sugar, leading to obesity and high blood pressure. Additionally, dining out is more expensive than cooking at home. Despite awareness of nutrition, many lack the time or motivation to plan and shop for healthy meals.

                    A Food Ingredient Shopping website can bridge this gap by offering fresh, high-quality ingredients and supporting local agriculture for fresher produce and reduced environmental impact. Meal kits, recipes, and tutorials make cooking easier and enjoyable, fostering confidence in home meal preparation. This initiative promotes healthier eating, cost savings, and stronger connections to local farmers, benefiting individuals and communities alike.
